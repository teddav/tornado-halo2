> [!WARNING]
> This is just for learning purposes. The code is unaudited (and probably pretty bad).

This repo is a rewrite of [Tornado Cash](https://github.com/tornadocash/tornado-core) with [Halo2](https://github.com/zcash/halo2).

Here's the article with a full explanation of the code: [Tornado Cash with Halo2](https://dev.to/teddav/tornado-cash-with-halo2-62b)

As stated in the article, some parts are "mostly copied" from https://github.com/summa-dev/halo2-experiments. Thanks [@enricobottazzi](https://github.com/enricobottazzi), [@sifnoc](https://github.com/sifnoc) and [@jtguibas](https://github.com/jtguibas).
